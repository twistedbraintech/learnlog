As a seasoned programmer, I find myself on day 5 of the [Hacking With Swift - SwiftUI free course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), and I must say, starting from scratch is far from boring. [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/about), an exceptional instructor, infuses the material with new perspectives throughout the course.

What caught my attention are some of his interesting points about how to successfully complete the course, which I fully intend to commit to.

### Quote From the Course:

"If you want to make a success of this course, there are only two rules:

1. Every day you spend one hour reading or watching SwiftUI tutorials, or writing SwiftUI code.
    
2. Every day you post about your progress to the social media site of your choosing. Tell people!
    

I’ll be providing all the material you need to follow along, so all you need to do is show up ready to learn. I’ve even provided a “Tweet” button at the end of every day, which composes a tweet for you saying you completed the day, and includes the hashtag to help others find you, a celebratory graphic, and a link for others to find out more – use it!

I’ve tried to make sure it takes less than one hour to complete each day, but there is a little natural variation. For example, day 4 is a little shorter because it has less ground to cover, and day 13 is a little longer because it has a few complex topics inside."

I am enthusiastic about completing this course in its entirety and sharing my progress here.

Kindly,  
TB
