Embarking on a new creative journey can be both exciting and intimidating, but with the right tools and guidance, anyone can bring their artistic visions to life. I've recently taken my first steps into the world of 3D modeling by diving into a tutorial on [Nomad Sculpt for iPad](https://nomadsculpt.com/), a powerful and user-friendly sculpting app designed for both beginners and professionals.

The tutorial by Dave Reed, which can be found on YouTube ([Nomad Sculpt Tutorial](https://youtu.be/8p_cprttJCo?si=CVGkLgwRkMKO-fQo)), offers a crash course for complete beginners, and I can attest to its effectiveness. With the app's intuitive interface and the tutorial's clear instructions, I was able to create my first 3D clay sculptureâ€”a charming and whimsical character set against a vibrant yellow background, as seen in the image below.

Nomad Sculpt harnesses the touch capabilities of the iPad, making the sculpting experience feel natural, almost like molding real clay. The version I used, 1.84, runs smoothly on my iPad Pro 2022 and allows for a great deal of creativity and detail.

As you can see from the resulting image, my initial foray into 3D modeling was a fair success. The character, with its bright pink hue and playful expression, stands as a testament to what beginners can achieve with Nomad Sculpt. The rounded edges, smooth surfaces, the eyes and smile were all crafted using the tools and techniques outlined in the tutorial.

In conclusion, my first attempt at 3D modeling was both educational and rewarding. The process demystified the world of digital sculpture for me, and I'm eager to continue exploring what I can create.
