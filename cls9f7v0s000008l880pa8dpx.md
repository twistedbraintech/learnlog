Hello, creative souls and fellow developers of "My Progress Log"! As I continue my journey through the fascinating world of [Blender](https://blender.org), I've stumbled upon a hidden gem within its vast capabilities – the built-in game engine known as [Armory3D](https://armory3d.org/). This discovery has opened a new door, one that leads to the interactive realm of game development, and I'm eager to step through it.

### Blender and Armory3D: A Powerful Duo

Blender, known for its comprehensive suite of 3D modeling and animation tools, also harbors Armory3D – a full-blown game engine integrated directly into the software. What makes Armory stand out is its unique approach to game scripting. It offers a visual node system for those who prefer a more graphical interface, as well as support for [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) – a versatile high-level, strictly typed programming language that is easy to learn and fast to execute.

### Why Armory3D?

The visual node system in Armory3D is a captivating feature that appeals to my creative side. It allows the visualization of game logic in a way that is intuitive and artist-friendly. This system lowers the barrier to game development, making it accessible even to those with minimal coding experience.

### Rekindling with Haxe

Having some familiarity with Haxe, the detour into Armory3D feels like a natural extension of my Blender learning curve. Haxe's cross-platform capabilities make it a perfect fit for a game engine that aspires to deploy games everywhere – from web browsers to mobile devices and beyond.

### The Best of Both Worlds

By exploring Armory3D, I'm not just learning to create static 3D scenes; I'm bringing them to life with interactivity and playfulness. It’s a step towards understanding how games are built from the ground up, how the static turns dynamic, and how the lifeless becomes engaging.

### What's to Lose? Absolutely Nothing

Taking this detour into Armory3D game development is a risk-free adventure. It's an investment in my skills, a broadening of my creative horizons, and perhaps, a step towards creating the next indie game sensation.

### Embracing the Wonders of Armory3D

As I embark on this new learning adventure with Armory3D, I invite you to join me in this exploration. Together, let's delve into the potential of Blender as a game development platform and discover what incredible interactive experiences we can craft.

Stay tuned for more updates on my adventures with Armory3D and Blender. The journey into game development is just beginning, and the possibilities are as boundless as our imagination.

## Addendum: The Versatility of Armory3D and Haxe

An exciting aspect of delving into Armory3D is the versatility it offers through its integration with Haxe. This powerful combination allows development across a multitude of platforms such as macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android. Moreover, its compatibility extends to web technologies, supporting both HTML5 and the emerging WebGPU with WebAssembly (WASM), making it an increasingly popular choice for robust web game development. The capability to deploy across these varied platforms opens up a world of possibilities for my upcoming projects.
