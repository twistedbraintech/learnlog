### Navigating the World of Swift Classes

Hello to all my dedicated followers on "My Progress Log"! Today marks another milestone in my coding journey – the completion of Day 12 in the [Hacking With Swift SwiftUI course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/12), where the spotlight was on Swift classes.

### A Shift from C# to Swift Classes

Coming from a C# background, I approached the topic of classes in Swift with a mix of curiosity and caution. Classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and I was intrigued to see how they are handled in Swift compared to .NET.

### The Confusing Yet Simpler Side of Swift Classes

Initially, the transition was a bit confusing. The syntax and structure of Swift classes have their peculiarities, differing from what I was accustomed to in C#. However, as I delved deeper into the lessons, a sense of relief washed over me. Swift's approach to classes is refreshingly straightforward and, in many ways, simpler than .NET. The lack of complexity in Swift's class system made it easier to grasp the concepts and apply them in practical scenarios.

### Key Learnings from the Day

One of the key takeaways from today’s session was understanding how Swift manages classes, their properties, methods, and inheritance. Swift’s syntax for classes is concise, and its handling of inheritance and initialization is more streamlined compared to the verbosity often found in .NET.

### Personal Reflections

The contrast between Swift and C# in handling object-oriented programming concepts has been enlightening. It’s fascinating to see how different languages tackle the same concept in distinct ways. Swift’s classes, with their simplicity and efficiency, have added a new dimension to my understanding of object-oriented programming.

### Looking Forward

As I continue to navigate through the [HWS-SUI course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), I’m eagerly anticipating the upcoming topics. Each day brings new challenges and learnings, and I’m excited to see how my growing knowledge of Swift will shape my future projects.
