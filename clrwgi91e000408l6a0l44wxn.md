### Shifting Focus in Response to Apple's EU Compliance Stance

Hello to all my readers and fellow developers at "My Progress Log." Today's post comes with a heavy heart as I announce my decision to step away from learning Swift and developing for Apple devices. This decision wasn't easy, but it's one that aligns with my values and principles, especially in light of recent developments regarding Apple's compliance with EU regulations.

### Reflecting on Apple's Stance

Apple's approach to the new EU regulations, which I came across in articles from [Pocket Gamer](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/83314/apple-rolls-out-unity-like-runtime-fee-as-it-seeks-to-outrun-new-eu-regulations/) and [Apple’s own fee calculator](https://developer.apple.com/support/fee-calculator-for-apps-in-the-eu/), has been a tipping point for me. The perceived hostility and arrogance in their compliance strategy do not sit well with my personal ethos. As someone from the EU, I feel strongly about these issues and believe in supporting frameworks and ecosystems that align more closely with my views on regulatory compliance and fairness.

### Embracing a New Direction

Thus, I've decided to pivot my focus towards web technologies. My journey forward will be centered around React, React Native, and Babylon.JS. These technologies offer a wide scope for creativity and innovation, and I'm excited to explore the vast possibilities they present in web and cross-platform development.

### Gratitude for the Apple Developer Community

I want to express my deepest gratitude to the Apple Developer community. This journey has been enriching and educational, and I've gained invaluable skills and insights. To all those I've interacted with, thank you for your support, knowledge, and the community spirit that makes the world of development so special.

### Looking Ahead with Optimism

Looking ahead, I'm enthusiastic about diving into new challenges and opportunities that React and other web technologies present. This shift marks not just a change in tools, but a broader perspective on development and a commitment to aligning my professional choices with my personal beliefs.

### Conclusion

So, it is with a mix of sadness and anticipation that I say goodbye to Swift and Apple development. I am eager to embark on this new chapter and share my experiences and learnings in the realms of React and web technologies.

Thank you for being a part of my journey thus far. I look forward to continuing to share my progress and insights in this exciting new direction.

# Navigating Apple's New License Fee Calculator: A Developer's Perspective

In a recent development that's stirring up the developer community, Apple has introduced a new license fee calculator for those of us who opt to use non-Apple in-app payment systems. As a staunch advocate for fair practices and a supporter of the EU's push for more open digital marketplaces, I find myself at an impasse with this change.

### The Core Technology Fee

The screenshot shared in this post highlights a "Core Technology Fee" – a substantial charge that appears to be levied on developers choosing alternative payment methods. This fee, in the absence of the traditional App Store commission, seems to be Apple's way of maintaining revenue while ostensibly complying with the new EU regulations.

### The Cost of Freedom: Apple's Compliance Fee Dilemma

Apple's new developer fee structure, a response to EU regulations promoting consumer choice, puts developers at a crossroads. We now face a stark choice: adhere to Apple's traditional in-app purchase system with its substantial fees or embrace the EU's vision of freedom by integrating alternative payment methods, potentially incurring hefty debts.

The calculator screenshot shared showcases a stark reality: an app with 1 million free installs and a preference for user choice over Apple's walled garden could leave a developer owing Apple over $45,000 just because it was popular and installed 2 million times that year. This fee, dubbed the "Core Technology Fee," applies even if the app is free and earns revenue only from those few users who opt to pay.

Such a scenario highlights the tension between legislative intent and corporate interpretation—freedom, it seems, comes at a high price.

### Compliance or Counteraction?

While compliance with local laws is necessary, the manner of Apple's adaptation could be seen as resistant, prompting questions about the balance between corporate strategy and regulatory adherence. For developers, particularly those within the EU, this new fee structure is a critical factor to consider in our business models and development choices.

### A Decision to Shift

After careful consideration, and with a firm belief in the principles behind the EU's regulations, I have decided to pivot away from Apple's ecosystem. The introduction of this fee calculator is more than a policy update—it's a reflection of a broader ethos that I find myself at odds with.

### Conclusion

This new development from Apple is a reminder of the ever-changing nature of the tech landscape and the importance of aligning our professional choices with our values. As I bid farewell to Swift and the Apple development platform, I look forward to the freedom and opportunities that the wider web development world has to offer.
