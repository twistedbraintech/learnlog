# 3D Game Dev

Hello, digital explorers of "My Progress Log"! As my journey through the landscape of JavaScript and React Native unfolds, I've been on a quest to find a 3D game engine that aligns with my aspirations. I'm excited to announce that I've found my mark with Babylon.js.

### Discovering the 3D Universe of Babylon.js

Babylon.js has emerged as a front-runner in my exploration. This robust engine offers an incredible array of features that cater to both beginners and seasoned developers. The best part? It's accessible right from my favorite workspace, the Mac, with a desktop editor that rivals the likes of Godot and Unity.

### A Hub of Creativity

The desktop editor for Mac (found at [Babylon.js Editor](https://editor.babylonjs.com/)) is a game-changer. It's intuitive, user-friendly, and makes the transition to 3D game development as smooth as can be. The resemblance to familiar editors ensures that I can jump right into creation without missing a beat.

### Expanding Knowledge with Zenva

My Zenva subscription has proven to be a treasure chest of resources. It includes not one, but two courses on Babylon.jsâ€”one focusing on game design and the other delving into the realms of VR and AR. The course "Build 3D Web Apps with Babylon.js" ([link to course](https://academy.zenva.com/course/build-3d-web-apps-with-babylon-js/)) is on my radar, promising to be an enlightening journey through 3D web application development.

### Anticipating a World of Possibilities

As I gear up to explore these courses, the excitement is palpable. I'm standing at the threshold of a world where I can bring my wildest game ideas to life, create immersive VR experiences, and push the boundaries of what's possible in web-based 3D environments.

### Grateful for the Path Ahead

My transition away from Swift hasn't been without its uncertainties, but the discovery of Babylon.js and the resources to learn it has reaffirmed my belief in this new direction. I'm optimistic about the future and eager to share the fruits of this journey with all of you.

Stay tuned for updates, project showcases, and the inevitable "aha" moments as I delve deeper into the Babylon.js universe!
