## Introduction

Hello everyone! I'm excited to share with you a new chapter in my life as a seasoned programmer. At 58 years old, I've spent decades immersed in the world of coding, navigating through various programming languages. Recently, I made a significant shift in my coding journey, moving away from languages like C#, a language I enjoyed but found its .NET paradigm overly complex and bloated. This shift led me to discover Swift, a language that resonated with me almost instantly. In this blog post, I want to take you along on my learning journey with Swift and SwiftUI, my exploration of game development with Godot, and how I'm blending these with creative tools like Nomad Sculpt and Blender.

## Why I Chose Swift

After researching cross-platform languages like Dart, Go, and Haxe, Swift stood out as the ideal choice for me. Its simplicity, efficiency, and the ability to develop across various Apple platforms made it incredibly appealing. I'm currently diving into Swift through a fantastic free course on [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/). The course is comprehensive and beginner-friendly, perfect for anyone looking to start or switch to Swift programming.

## The Transition to Game Development

I've always had a passion for game development, previously working with Unity. However, after a significant announcement from Unity, I decided to explore other options and found Godot to be an exceptional alternative. Godot's open-source nature and ease of use make it a great tool for indie game developers like myself. I'm currently following the Godot Mini Degree on [Zenva](https://zenva.com), which is a fantastic resource for anyone looking to get into Godot game development.

## The Concept of SwiftGodot and SwiftGodotKit

One of my main goals is to integrate Swift and Godot into a cohesive development toolchain. I envision [SwiftGodot and SwiftGodotKit](https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftGodotDocs/tutorials/swiftgodot-tutorials/) as key components of this integration, allowing for a seamless blend of Swift's programming efficiency and Godot's game development capabilities. This synergy will enable me to develop games and applications more creatively and effectively.

## Expanding My Creative Horizons

Alongside programming, I'm also focusing on enhancing my creative skills. Tools like Nomad Sculpt and Blender are on my learning list, as they offer incredible capabilities for 3D modeling and animation. This isn't just about adding another skill to my repertoire; it's about integrating these creative aspects into my development process, enriching the games and applications I build.

## The Journey Ahead

Embarking on this journey is both thrilling and daunting. There's a long road ahead filled with learning and experimentation. But for me, it's not about reaching a final destination. It's about the journey itself, the continuous process of learning, growing, and creating. I don't believe there's ever a true endpoint in a programmer's life, as technology and creativity are constantly evolving.

## Conclusion

As I progress through my Swift and Godot learning paths, I'll be documenting my experiences and insights here. This blog will serve as a log of my progress, challenges, and triumphs. Whether you're a fellow programmer, a game developer, or just someone interested in the intersection of technology and creativity, I invite you to follow along and perhaps find inspiration for your own journey.

To all aspiring programmers and game developers out there, remember that it's never too late to start something new or take your skills in a different direction. At 58, I'm proof that passion and a willingness to learn can open up a world of possibilities, no matter your age. Let's embrace the journey together and see where this path takes us!

Letâ€™s go!
