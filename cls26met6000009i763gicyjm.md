# My Blender 4.X Journey Begins

Hello, adventurers and creators of "My Progress Log"! In my quest to craft a game infused with mystery, humor, and a touch of whimsy, I've taken a pivotal step: diving into the world of 3D modeling with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/$) 4.X.

### The Search for Contemporary Learning

My hunt for the perfect Blender beginner's course was no small feat. The internet is brimming with tutorials, but many were anchored to previous versions. As a beginner, I needed something up-to-date, something that spoke the language of the latest Blender iteration.

### Discovering 3D Tudor on Packt

Just when I was about to settle for less, I stumbled upon a goldmine â€“ not one, but 3 courses by 3D Tudor on my [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/) subscription. These courses are fresh from the digital press of 2023, tailored to Blender 4.X, and ready to guide me through the nuances of modern 3D modeling.

### Why 3D Tudor?

[3D Tudor's](https://3dtudor.gumroad.com/) teaching style resonates with me. It's clear, engaging, and breaks down complex 3D concepts into manageable, bite-sized lessons. These courses promise to take me from Blender basics to creating stylized, game-ready assets.

### The Vision for My Game

Envisioning a game in the vein of [Myst and Firmament from Cyan](https://cyan.com/games/), I plan to blend the first-person puzzle adventure with a stylized aesthetic reminiscent of the first 3D Zelda game ([**The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening)**](https://www.nintendo.dk/nintendo-switch-familien/spil/the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening).

Picture this: a world where every corner hides a puzzle, each solution leads to laughter, and cuteness is the guiding star.

### Completing My Toolbox

With my newfound knowledge in Babylon.js and the upcoming mastery of Blender, my developer's toolbox is nearly complete. It's thrilling to think that soon I'll be able to model my own assets for the fantastical gaming experiences I dream of creating.

### Embarking on the Modelling Journey

Now, the journey truly begins. As I delve into the intricacies of Blender with 3D Tudor, I invite you to join me in witnessing the transformation of abstract ideas into the building blocks of my very own game world.

Stay tuned for updates, showcases of my first models, and the inevitable trials and triumphs of learning Blender. Here's to the puzzles, adventures, and stories waiting to be told through the magic of 3D modeling!
