Hello again to all my readers at "My Progress Log"! Today marks the second day of my foray into the Godot Mini Degree at Zenva Academy, and I'm excited to share my experiences so far.

Godot, as a game engine, has been a revelation. Its straightforward, user-friendly interface has made my initial steps into game development both enjoyable and intuitive. I'm genuinely impressed by how accessible it is for beginners, yet powerful enough for complex projects.

Over these two days, I've dived into the basics of both 2D and 3D aspects of Godot. The sessions on lighting and meshes were particularly enlightening. It's fascinating to see how these elements come together to create immersive gaming environments. The practical, hands-on approach of the course has allowed me to experiment and learn effectively.

The real excitement, however, is about what's coming next - scripting in GDScript. GDScript is Godotâ€™s native scripting language, and from what I've heard, it's both powerful and easy to grasp, especially for those familiar with Python. The prospect of bringing my game ideas to life through code is thrilling.

I'm looking forward to diving into the scripting part of the course. This is where I believe the real magic happens - where the ideas in my head start taking shape in the digital world. Scripting is where the game's mechanics, interactions, and logic come into play, and I can't wait to get my hands dirty with it.

Stay tuned for more updates as I progress through the Godot Mini Degree. Each day is a step closer to realizing my dream of creating my own game. Here's to learning and growing in the world of game development!

***Until next time, keep coding and keep creating!***

## **Upcoming Adventures in Coding: Unveiling My Dream Projects**

As I journey through the realms of Swift and Godot, my aspirations are taking shape into two exciting game concepts.

ðŸ”® **The Puzzle Adventure: A Myst-style Odyssey in Godot** Imagine a world where every turn reveals a new puzzle, every scene a breathtaking view, reminiscent of the classic Myst adventures. Using the versatility of Godot, I'm dreaming of crafting a puzzle adventure game that's not just a play of logic, but a feast for the senses. Picture intricate puzzles embedded in stunning 3D landscapes, where each solution brings you closer to unraveling the mysteries of a forgotten realm.

ðŸ“œ **The Text-Based Saga: A Journey in Ink on SwiftUI** But why stop at visual splendor? I'm also venturing into the narrative-rich world of text-based games. Inspired by Ink from Inkle, I plan to use SwiftUI to create an immersive text-based game for iPhone and iPad. This isn't just about reading text on a screen; it's about making choices that weave your unique story. Imagine a game where every decision you make spins the narrative in a new direction, creating a tapestry of stories that are uniquely yours.

These projects are more than just games; they are windows to worlds unknown, stories untold, puzzles unsolved. Stay tuned to "My Progress Log" as I bring these dreams to life with Swift and Godot!
