Hello, creators and curious minds at "My Progress Log"! My coding journey has led me to an exciting new course on Udemy: "[Full BabylonJS Game Dev: 2D, 3D Online with Colyseus.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-babylonjs-game-dev-2d-3d-online-with-colyseusjs/)" by [Pierre Billaud](https://linktr.ee/pierrebio). This discovery is the next leap in my foray into the vibrant territory of game development with [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/).

### A New Perspective on Game Development

Pierre Billaud's course ([find it here on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-babylonjs-game-dev-2d-3d-online-with-colyseusjs/)) offers a refreshing take on 2.5D and 3D exploration game design. As Pierre's debut course, it stands out with its clarity and approachability, making the learning process both delightful and intuitive.

### Follow-Along Style Learning

The follow-along style of the course aligns perfectly with my hands-on learning preference. It's one thing to read about game development theory, but quite another to code and design in tandem with an experienced instructor. Pierre's structured approach is well-suited for learners like me who benefit from actively doing as they learn.

### Anticipating the Coding Adventure

I'm eagerly looking forward to the next section, where I'll be coding my first game under Pierre's guidance in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) something new to me. This step is not just about absorbing information; it's about applying it in a way that brings creative ideas to life.

### A Gateway to Design and Development

Courses like these are gateways to new skills and horizons. With each lecture, I feel more equipped to tackle the challenges of game development and design. The integration of Babylon.js with [Colyseus.js](https://colyseus.io/) for online gaming promises a comprehensive education that I can't wait to explore further.

### A Note of Thanks

A special shout-out to Pierre Billaud ([connect with him here](https://linktr.ee/pierrebio)) for crafting such an accessible and engaging course. His work is a testament to the power of sharing knowledge and empowering others to create and innovate.

### Closing Thoughts

As I prepare to dive into the coding and design phase, I'm filled with anticipation for what's to come. I invite you all to join me on this adventure with Babylon.js, where the boundaries between code, game, and creativity blur into one thrilling experience.

Stay tuned for updates and insights as I progress through this course and beyond into the universe of 3D game development!
