### A Learner’s Perspective

Hello everyone at “My Progress Log”! I’ve taken an exciting step in my coding journey – I’ve subscribed to [Hacking With Swift](https://hackingwithswift.com) Plus (HWS+), Paul Hudson’s renowned course and news site. After having a rewarding experience with Tim Corey’s .NET and C# tutorials on “[iamtimcorey.com](https://www.iamtimcorey.com/)”, I felt inspired to dive deeper into Swift in a similar manner.

### Learning from the Best

Both Tim Corey and Paul Hudson are exceptional educators. They have this unique ability to simplify complex concepts, making them accessible to learners of all levels. My transition from C# to Swift, guided by Paul’s insights, has been nothing short of enjoyable. His teaching style resonates with me, turning each lesson into an engaging learning experience.

### A Contrast in User Experience

However, as much as I admire Tim and Paul for their teaching prowess, I’ve noticed a similar trend in the user experience of their sites. While Paul has an app called Unwrap, which is a great standalone learning tool for Swift, it’s intriguing that the full range of HWS+ content isn’t integrated into this app.

When I subscribed to HWS+, part of my expectation was streamlined access to all content, including the free resources like the “[100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)” course I’m currently pursuing. Unfortunately, this wasn’t the case. Don’t get me wrong, the subscription is still incredibly valuable – I’m able to access a wealth of courses and content that Paul offers.

### Expectations of Digital Learning Platforms

Yet, in an era where digital learning is more prevalent than ever, one might anticipate a more cohesive Learning Management System (LMS) and a corresponding iPad app, especially from coding experts like Tim and Paul. An integrated platform would not only enhance the learning experience but also reflect the technological expertise they both embody.

### Supporting the Vision

I subscribed to HWS+ to support Paul’s outstanding work and contribute to the community he’s building. His dedication to teaching and sharing knowledge is commendable, and being a part of this learning journey is rewarding in many ways.

### Moving Forward

Despite the minor setback in terms of platform integration, the quality of the learning material is undeniable. As I continue with “100 Days of SwiftUI” and explore other resources on HWS+, I look forward to gaining deeper insights into Swift and applying them to my projects.

I believe that as the digital education landscape evolves, so will the platforms of educators like Tim and Paul. Until then, I’m happy to navigate their current offerings, absorbing the wealth of knowledge they share.

> Thank you, Tim and Paul, for your invaluable contributions to the coding community. Here’s to many more lessons and breakthroughs in my coding journey!
