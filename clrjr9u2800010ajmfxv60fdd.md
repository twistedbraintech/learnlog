### Pausing Godot to Focus on Swift and Apple‚Äôs Ecosystem

Hello to all who follow my journey on ‚ÄúMy Progress Log.‚Äù Today, I find myself at a crossroads in my learning path. After spending some time delving into Godot and two books about game development in Swift, I am considering a strategic pivot towards a more Swift-centric approach for my game development aspirations.

As I‚Äôve immersed myself in Godot, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice the capabilities of Xcode‚Äôs 2D and 3D editors. These tools seem to align seamlessly with the requirements for developing games specifically for Apple platforms. This realization sparked a thought - perhaps dedicating my time to mastering Swift, SwiftUI, SpriteKit, SceneKit, and Vapor might be a more cohesive and efficient approach to achieving my goals.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong - Godot is an incredible engine, offering a vast array of features and flexibility. However, the allure of keeping everything within the Swift ecosystem is becoming increasingly appealing. The integration and native support that Swift and its frameworks provide for Apple devices is a significant advantage, particularly for someone who is primarily focused on developing for iOS and macOS.

Moreover, focusing on Swift and related technologies would allow me to dive deeper into Apple‚Äôs development environment, possibly leading to more optimized and streamlined app and game development. SwiftUI, SpriteKit, and SceneKit are robust tools for creating engaging user interfaces and immersive game experiences, while Vapor opens up possibilities for server-side Swift applications.

So, for now, I‚Äôve decided to put my Godot studies on hold. This isn‚Äôt a goodbye to Godot, but rather a strategic pause. My plan is to further explore and master the tools and languages that align more closely with the Apple ecosystem. [SwiftGodotKit](https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftGodotDocs/tutorials/swiftgodot-tutorials/) remains an interesting prospect for the future, and I might revisit Godot when I can integrate it more effectively with my Swift-based projects.

This decision hasn‚Äôt been easy, but I believe that focusing on Swift and its related frameworks will yield the best results for my specific goals. I am excited to see where this focused approach will take me and how it will shape my development skills.

Thank you for being a part of my journey. I look forward to sharing more of my experiences and learnings as I delve deeper into the world of Swift and Apple‚Äôs development tools.

Stay tuned, as there‚Äôs much more to come!
