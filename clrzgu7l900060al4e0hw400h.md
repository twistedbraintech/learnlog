### Embracing React Native and More

Greetings to all tech enthusiasts! Recent shifts in my professional course have led me to a refreshing return to JavaScript, a language that feels like home. With faith as my guide, I’ve chosen to tread a new path towards React Native, starting with a much-needed refresher in modern JavaScript.

### Back to Basics with Brad Traversy

I discovered a treasure trove of knowledge in my Packt Publishing subscription, finding three courses that are nothing short of serendipitous. Brad Traversy’s “Modern JavaScript from the Beginning,” “70+ JavaScript Challenges,” and “React Front to Back 2022” courses have reignited my passion for development. Brad’s clear and engaging teaching style makes reacquainting with JavaScript principles an enjoyable experience.

### The Right Time for React Native

The timing couldn’t be more perfect. The tech landscape is buzzing with advancements—React Native is becoming faster, and BabylonJS Native is set to leverage WebGPU. This is a thrilling time to be diving into the world of cross-platform development.

### A Diverse Background as an Asset

My previous forays into .NET, C#, and Swift have not been in vain. They have enriched my skill set, allowing me to think more expansively about JS and C bindings in Swift iOS apps and how React can be interwoven into .NET MAUI applications.

### Looking Forward with Optimism

With these new courses, I’m not just learning; I’m preparing to contribute to the fast-evolving ecosystem of modern app development. My journey through different languages and frameworks has been a mosaic of experiences that now inform my approach to JavaScript and React Native.

> I am optimistic about this path. It feels right, aligning with the technical and ethical contours of my career. I am excited to share my progress as I delve deeper into the vibrant world of JavaScript, React, and beyond.

Stay tuned for updates, insights, and discoveries along this promising new path!
