### Days 9-11 of HWS Course in one go

Greetings once again to all the followers of "My Progress Log"! In an exhilarating burst of learning, I've just completed days 8 through 11 of the Hacking With Swift (HWS) “[100 days of SwiftUI course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)”. My journey through these days has been marked by a significant pickup in pace and a deeper appreciation for Swift's intuitive nature, especially in comparison to my previous experience with C#.

### Swift’s Intuitive Edge

One of the most striking realizations during these sessions was how intuitive Swift feels compared to C#. The language's syntax and structure seem to flow more naturally, making the process of learning and applying new concepts smoother and more enjoyable.

### A Deep Dive into Swift Closures

The standout topic over these past few days was undoubtedly Swift's closures. Getting to grips with closure initialization was both challenging and enlightening. Closures, being self-contained blocks of functionality, opened my eyes to the versatility of Swift. The way Swift handles closures is akin to how .NET utilizes classes, yet with a unique flavor that simplifies many complex programming paradigms.

### Realizations and Anticipations

This deep dive led to an interesting realization: Swift, while having its own system of classes, often leverages functions in ways that resonate with class-based structures in .NET. This parallel was fascinating to explore and understand, particularly in seeing how different languages approach similar concepts.

### Looking Forward to Classes in Swift

As I move forward, the anticipation of learning about classes in Swift is growing. Given my background with C#, I'm particularly excited to see how Swift handles object-oriented programming and to compare its approach to what I'm accustomed to with .NET.}

### Conclusion

In conclusion, days 9-11 of the HWS SwiftUI course have been a whirlwind of learning, solidifying my understanding of Swift's fundamentals and its more advanced features like closures. I'm eager to continue this momentum and delve deeper into the world of Swift, especially as I approach the subject of classes.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue on this swift journey of learning SwiftUI!
